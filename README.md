# ELEC0134 Applied Machine Learning Systems Assignment

Both Task A and Task B are seperated in different folder indicating for each task. The datasets used should be placed in the Datasets folder.


## Task A
In Task A, the file to run the model is the `A.py`. The CNN model used is already saved in the folder A. If you wish to train the model again, remove the comment on the train and save model and model's history. You should **save** the model first if you want to plot the training curves for the model or else there will be an **error**.

## Task B
In Task B, the file to run the model is the `B.py`. The CNN model used is already saved in the folder B. If you wish to train the model again, remove the comment on the train and save model and  save model's history. You should **save** the model and model's history first if you want to plot the training curves for the model or else there will be an **error**.

## Run the project
1. The project can be run by using `main.py`.

2. To run the code simply run the following code in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Packages
The packages required to run the code is `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, `sckit-learn`.
